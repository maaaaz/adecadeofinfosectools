Malware authors encode strings in their programs to hide malicious capabilities and impede reverse engineering. Even simple encoding schemes defeat the ‘strings’ tool and complicate static and dynamic analysis. FLOSS uses advanced static analysis techniques, such as emulation, to deobfuscate encoded strings.FLOSS is extremely easy to use and works against a large corpus of malware. It follows a similar invocation as the ‘strings’ tool. Users that understand how to interpret the strings found in a binary will understand FLOSS’s output. FLOSS extracts higher value strings, as strings that are obfuscated typically contain the most sensitive configuration resources – including C2 server addresses, names of dynamically resolved imports, suspicious file paths, and other IOCs.","* Malware analysis

A few examples of testing areas covered by Needle include: data storage, inter-process communication, network communications, static code analysis, hooking and binary protections. The only requirement in order to run Needle effectively is a jailbroken device.With the release of Needle v1.0.0, we provided a major overhaul of its core and the introduction of a new native agent, written entirely in Objective-C.

To prevent this from occuring, a whole industry has popped up with the aim of stopping exfiltration attacks. However, often these are expensive and rarely work as expected.
